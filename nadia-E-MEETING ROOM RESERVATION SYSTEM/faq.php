			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

			<hr>
    <h4>
1.	How do I know if my reservation is confirmed?</h4>
<p>
	As soon as you've completed the reservation process, a confirmation page will appear. This page shows all of your reservation details, including the reservation number, so you can access your confirmation online at E-MEETING ROOM.com. We'll also send you a confirmation email with all of your reservation information.
</p>
<br>
		
    <h4>
2.	How do I pay the reservation bill?</h4>
<p>
You can pay the bill via cash or by credit card and also debit card transaction during the reservation process.
</p>
<br>
	
    <h4>
3.	What about security for the rest of the reservation form?</h4>
<p>
We maintain the highest level of security and privacy so that we can safely store certain personal reservation information, including credit card numbers, to ensure your personal preferences are honored. 
</p>
<br>

	
    <h4>
4.	How can I see how much it will cost?</h4>
<p>
Once you've entered the dates of your reservation and choose your event name, the rates will be clearly displayed along with the reservation room types and the details.
</p>
<br>

    <h4>
5.	Why can't I book a reservation online for tomorrow?</h4>

Facilities have restrictions on the minimum number of days between the date you reserve and the date of your arrival. You will most likely see a 'First-Come-First-Served' message, implying that you will need to book a reservation a week earlier.
